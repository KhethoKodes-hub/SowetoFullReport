📘 Overview

This repository/document set contains all the materials from the Soweto Water Wise Outreach Programme, which ran from Day 1 fieldwork in Orlando through to the final community summit.
The goal was to collect and analyse quantitative and qualitative data on water access, usage behaviour, infrastructure perception, and conservation awareness in Soweto.

The insights gathered here form the foundation for upcoming outreach activations in Thembisa and Alexandra, and guide data-driven decision-making for Rand Water and Water Wise programmes.

🔍 How to Read the Data

1. Quantitative data (numbers, charts, tables):

Each chart or bar represents response frequency or percentage of total participants (n = 292).

Tallest bar = most common response.

Pie charts show the proportional share of each category (larger slice = higher occurrence).

Excel summary tables include grouped insights (e.g., by dwelling type or by frequency of shortage).

2. Qualitative data (stories, quotes, notes):

Found in the PDF report and qualitative summary sections.

These provide contextual evidence explaining why the numbers look the way they do.

Example: Many residents reuse greywater not from awareness but necessity due to unreliable supply.

3. Statistical terms used:

Frequency — count of responses.

Proportion / Percentage — share relative to total sample.

Correlation — relationship between two variables (e.g., water meter condition vs. shortage frequency).

Insight extraction — identifying actionable patterns from quantitative and qualitative data.

📊 Key Highlights from the Data

Sample Size: 292 total participants (Day 1–3 + Summit)

Primary Issues Identified:

Recurring water shortages and pressure drops.

Faulty or damaged water meters.

Poor communication or notification before outages.

Lack of clear reporting channels and accountability.

Visible water wastage through leaks and poor maintenance.

Behavioural Insights:

Many households practice informal greywater reuse.

Awareness and education about leak reporting is low but willingness to learn is high.

Residents prefer in-person support over call centres due to perceived inaction.

Community Recommendations:

More educational workshops and hands-on training.

Plumbers and technical teams stationed locally.

JoJo tanks and alternative storage for emergency supply.

Transparent communication on outage schedules.

💡 How to Use This Data

For Management & Decision-Makers:

Use summary tables and charts to identify priority areas for intervention.

Focus resources on high-shortage and low-awareness clusters.

Incorporate insights into the Alexandra Outreach Plan and broader Water Wise Education Programme.

For Technical & Operations Teams:

Overlay this dataset with infrastructure maintenance records to pinpoint recurring problem zones.

Use metrics to develop a dashboard (Power BI / Tableau / Google Data Studio) for continuous tracking.

For Communications & Community Teams:

Convert key findings into public-friendly visuals and storytelling content for social media, radio, and print.

Highlight success stories of communities adopting water-wise practices.
